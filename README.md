Welcome to the Amazon Sales Analysis project! In this project, we delve into analyzing sales
data from Amazon to extract insights and trends that can help optimize sales strategies,
understand customer behavior, and improve business operations.
## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing Amazon sales records, including
information such as sales dates, customer details, product categories, and revenue figures. By
leveraging SQL queries and data analysis techniques, we aim to answer various questions and
uncover valuable insights from the dataset.
## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project consists of 9994 rows of data, representing Amazon
sales transactions. Along with the sales data, the dataset includes information about customers,
products, orders, and returns. Before analysis, the dataset underwent preprocessing to handle
missing values and ensure data quality.
## Analysis Questions Resolved
During the analysis, the following key questions were addressed using SQL queries and data
analysis techniques:
1. Retrieve the total number of customers in the database.
2. Calculate the total number of sellers registered on Amazon.
3. List all unique product categories available.
4. Find the top 5 best-selling products by quantity sold.
5. Determine the total revenue generated from sales.
6. List all customers who have made at least one return.
7. Calculate the average price of products sold.
8. Identify the top 3 states with the highest total sales.
9. Find the product category with the highest average sale price.
10. List all orders with a sale amount greater than $100.
11. Calculate the total number of returns processed.
12. Identify the top-selling seller based on total sales amount.
13. List the products with the highest quantity sold in each category.
14. Determine the average sale amount per order.
15. Find the top 5 customers who have spent the most money.
16. Calculate the total number of orders placed in each state.
17. Identify the product sub-category with the highest total sales.
18. Top 5 products whose revenue has decreased in comparison to previous year.
19. Determine the month with the highest number of orders.
20. Calculate the profit margin percentage for each sale (Profit divided by Sales).
21. Calculate the percentage contribution of each sub-category to the total sales amount for the year 2023.
22. List the orders with the highest quantity of products purchased.
23. Calculate the average sale amount for each product category.
24. Find the top-selling seller based on the number of orders processed.
25. Identify the customers who have made returns more than once

An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) has been created to visualize the relationships between
the tables in the dataset. This diagram provides a clear understanding of the data structure and
helps in identifying key entities and their attributes.
## Getting Started
